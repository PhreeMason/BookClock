# Deadline Calendar Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the **deadline progress calendar** feature for the stats page using `react-native-calendars`. 

**IMPORTANT: This calendar is focused exclusively on reading deadline progress, NOT general book reading logs. It displays daily progress made towards reading deadlines only.**

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Package Installation
- ✅ Verified `react-native-calendars` package is already installed
- ✅ Package is compatible with Expo/React Native project

### 2. Data Layer (`src/hooks/useReadingHistory.ts` - `useDeadlineHistory`)
- ✅ **CORRECTED**: Created React Query hook for fetching deadline progress data (not general book logs)
- ✅ Supports configurable date ranges (7d, 30d, 90d, 1y, all)
- ✅ Supports format filtering (reading, listening, combined, all)
- ✅ Queries `reading_deadlines` table with `reading_deadline_progress` joins
- ✅ **FIXED**: UTC date conversion now prevents timezone shift bugs
- ✅ **IMPROVED**: Progress calculation logic properly handles deadline creation dates
- ✅ Calculates daily progress differences to show progress made each day
- ✅ Aggregates deadline progress by date with proper progress calculations
- ✅ Tracks active vs completed deadlines
- ✅ Implements proper React Query caching (5min stale, 30min cache)
- ✅ Memoizes calendar marking data for performance

### 3. Calendar Component (`src/components/ReadingCalendar.tsx`)
- ✅ **CORRECTED**: Calendar now shows deadline progress, not general reading activity
- ✅ Uses react-native-calendars with custom theme matching app design
- ✅ **FIXED**: Color-coded dots now use proper hex color values:
  - Blue (#007AFF): Reading deadlines only (physical/ebook)
  - Orange (#FF9500): Audio deadlines only 
  - Purple (#AF52DE): Mixed deadline types worked on
- ✅ **IMPROVED**: Calendar clicking now works for all marked dates (creation + progress)
- ✅ Integrates with existing `ReadingListeningToggle` for filtering
- ✅ Shows deadline-focused summary statistics (active days, progress made, active deadlines)
- ✅ Handles loading and error states
- ✅ Responsive design with proper spacing and typography

### 4. Day Details Modal (`src/components/ReadingDayDetails.tsx`)
- ✅ **CORRECTED**: Modal now displays deadline progress details, not general book logs
- ✅ Shows selected date with formatted display
- ✅ **FIXED**: Date display now handles timezone conversion properly to prevent date shifts
- ✅ Displays daily summary stats (total progress, deadlines worked, completed)
- ✅ Lists all deadlines worked on that day with:
  - Book title and author
  - Format icon and color coding
  - Progress made that specific day
  - Total progress and completion percentage
  - Deadline date and source
- ✅ Respects format filtering from parent component
- ✅ Proper theming and responsive design
- ✅ Empty state handling for days with no deadline activity

### 5. Stats Page Integration (`src/app/(authenticated)/stats.tsx`)
- ✅ Added calendar import
- ✅ Integrated calendar after Weekly Reading Heatmap section
- ✅ Passes selectedCategory and dateRange props
- ✅ Updated section comment numbering
- ✅ Maintains consistent styling with other stat cards

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface DailyDeadlineEntry {
  date: string;
  deadlines: Array<{
    id: string;
    book_title: string;
    author?: string;
    format: 'physical' | 'ebook' | 'audio';
    progress_made: number; // progress made on this specific day
    total_progress: number; // cumulative progress as of this day
    total_quantity: number; // total pages/minutes to read
    deadline_date: string;
    source: string;
    flexibility: string;
  }>;
  totalProgressMade: number; // total progress made across all deadlines this day
}
```

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Deadline Focus**: EXCLUSIVELY shows reading deadline progress, not general book activity
2. **Data Separation**: Maintains reading/listening deadline format separation per project requirements
3. **Performance**: Uses React Query caching and memoization
4. **Theming**: Fully integrated with app's theming system
5. **Accessibility**: Proper color contrast and touch targets
6. **Responsive**: Works on different screen sizes
7. **User Experience**: Intuitive interaction patterns for deadline tracking

### Integration Points
- Uses existing `ReadingListeningToggle` component
- Follows established component patterns from other charts
- Leverages existing themed components (`ThemedText`, `ThemedView`)
- Uses consistent icon naming from `IconSymbol`

## 🧪 Testing Status

### Functional Testing
- ✅ Calendar displays correctly with app theme
- ✅ Date marking works for different activity types
- ✅ **FIXED & TESTED**: Day selection opens modal with correct date data (no timezone shifts)
- ✅ Format filtering updates calendar display
- ✅ Summary statistics calculate correctly
- ✅ Modal displays book details properly
- ✅ Error states handle gracefully

### Test Coverage Added
- ✅ Created `ReadingCalendar.dateClick.test.tsx` - Tests calendar date clicking functionality
- ✅ Created `dateConversion.test.ts` - Unit tests for UTC date conversion functions
- ✅ All tests passing with proper date handling verification

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Calendar scrolling is smooth
- [ ] Large date ranges don't cause performance issues
- [ ] Data fetching doesn't block UI
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Days with no activity
- [ ] Days with mixed reading/listening
- [ ] Books without authors
- [ ] Very long book titles
- [ ] Missing or corrupt data

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Date Range Picker**: Allow users to select custom date ranges
2. **Export Functionality**: Export calendar data to other formats
3. **Goal Tracking**: Visual indicators for daily/weekly goals
4. **Reading Streaks**: Highlight current and longest streaks
5. **Mood Tracking**: Display emotional state data if available
6. **Statistics Overlay**: Show monthly/weekly summaries
7. **Sharing**: Share reading calendar achievements

### Technical Debt
- Consider moving calendar data transformation to a separate utility
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Implement offline data caching
- Add unit tests for date calculations

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### Date Handling Issues (Fixed)
- **Problem**: Clicking calendar dates showed data from the wrong date (e.g., clicking June 25 showed June 24 data)
- **Root Cause**: Timezone conversion bugs in date parsing (`new Date(dateString)` causing UTC to local time shifts)
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `ReadingDayDetails.tsx` to parse YYYY-MM-DD safely: `new Date(year, month - 1, day)`
  - Added `getLocalDateString()` helper in `useReadingHistory.ts` for consistent UTC date handling
  - Comprehensive test coverage to prevent regressions

### Calendar Display Issues (Fixed)
- **Problem**: Calendar dots not appearing on some dates with activity
- **Root Cause**: Database query using `!inner` join was excluding deadlines without progress entries
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed `!inner` join to include all deadlines
  - Improved logic to show deadline creation dates even with 0 progress
  - Fixed invalid color strings (`'#blue'` → `'#007AFF'`)

### Click Handling Issues (Fixed)
- **Problem**: Some calendar dates with dots were not clickable
- **Root Cause**: Click handler only allowed dates with `totalProgressMade > 0`
- **Solution**: Updated to allow clicking any date with data (creation or progress)

## 📝 Notes
- Calendar integrates seamlessly with existing data architecture
- Maintains project's strict reading/listening data separation
- Uses established patterns for consistency
- Performance optimized with proper caching strategies
- **Timezone-safe**: All date handling now prevents cross-timezone bugs
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests prevent future date-related regressions
- Ready for further feature expansion
